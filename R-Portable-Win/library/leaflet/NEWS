leaflet 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add support for sf. sf, sfc, and sfg classes are supported with POINT,
  LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, POLYGON, and MULTIPOLYGON geometries (note
  that MULTIPOINT is not currently supported).

* Added support for Crosstalk (https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/).

* Added option to highlight polygons, polylines, circles, and rectangles on
  hover (use highlightOptions parameter).

* Fix behavior when data contains NA points, or zero rows. Previously this would
  cause an error.

* Added `popupOptions` parameter to all markers and shape layers.

  missing/new functionality from those plugins. (PR #293)

* Added Proj4Leaflet plugin (PR #294).

* Color palette functions now support reversing the order in which colors are
  used, via reverse=TRUE.

* `colorFactor` no longer interpolates qualitative RColorBrewer palettes,
  unless the number of factor levels being mapped exceeds the number of colors
  in the specified RColorBrewer palette. (Issue #300)

* Upgrade leaflet.js to 0.7.7.1 (PR #359)

* Added a way for the Map instance to be instantiated via a factory.

leaflet 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When used with `leafletProxy`, `fitBounds` did not return its input object as
  output, so magrittr chains would break after `fitBounds` was called.

  areas, via the leaflet-measure plugin by @ljagis. (PR #171. Thanks, Kenton
  Russell!)
