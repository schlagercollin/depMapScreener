Description: R lists, especially nested lists, can be very difficult to
    visualize or represent. Sometimes 'str()' is not enough, so this suite of
    htmlwidgets is designed to help see, understand, and maybe even modify your R
    lists.  The function 'reactjson()' requires a package
    'reactR' that can be installed from CRAN or <https://github.com/timelyportfolio/reactR>.
